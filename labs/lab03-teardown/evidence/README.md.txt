What each build still needs:

Both computers need a PC case, monitor, keyboard, mouse and operating system. Additional case fans may be needed for proper airflow. A dedicated graphics card is optional because both processors have integrated graphics.

## Part 2 — Same facts, two computing environments
Hardware fact	Windows Host	Linux VM
CPU	AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS	AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS (virtualized)
CPU cores / vCPUs	6 physical cores	4 virtual CPUs
Logical processors	12	4
Architecture	x86_64	x86_64
RAM	16 GB	1.6 GiB
Memory speed	5600 MT/s (configured at 4800 MT/s)	Not reported
Storage	512 GB Kingston NVMe SSD	25 GB virtual disk
Filesystem	NTFS	Linux filesystem
Environment	Physical computer	Virtual machine

Windows and Linux use different commands and tools to display hardware information. Windows uses PowerShell commands such as Get-CimInstance, while Linux uses lscpu, free -h and lsblk. Linux runs inside a virtual machine, so it sees allocated virtual resources rather than all the physical resources of the host computer.

## What did not work the first time

Copying and pasting commands in the Linux environment did not work at first. Because of this, I had to type all the commands manually when creating the `linux-specs.txt` file. I did not experience this problem in Windows, where copying and pasting worked correctly.
